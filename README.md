## Overview

This is a music app project, developed with the freeCodeCamp learning trail, where there is interactivity via pure Javascript. You can play, pause, go to the next song or go to the previous song, as well as leave the playlist in random mode!

## My process

It was designed to develop all interactivity with Javascript. Following the instructions, I created the site's responsiveness and reached the final product.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

On this opportunity, I was able to reinforce my learning with DOM elements and have the experience of creating all the Javascript code from scratch.


### Continued development

I'm focusing on better understanding about DOM.
